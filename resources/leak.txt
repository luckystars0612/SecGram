Leakbase -  This is also another good website for downloading breached databases.

BTDigg - This is the best one, most of the paid breached databases you have seen, like the 000webhost, RF databases, collection 1-5, etc are free over here. This website works by indexing through your search query. Just search "leaked database" to find tons of huge files with breached databases. If you are looking for the RF databases, just look up "raid forums" and scroll down and you will see. Remember, these are all magnet links, some torrent might be dead, you just gotta hope they will be alive at one point.

DarkArmy -  They don't have a WIDE range of databases, but they still do have some, and they are free I believe.

Sizeofcat - This has some great databases for download like Naz.api, Raidforums db, NVIDIA just to name a few.

BreachForums - The best one always  Heart

Good Luck!!!!!
